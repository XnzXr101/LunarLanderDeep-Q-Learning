# LunarLanderDeep-Q-Learning
The Lunar Lander environment in Atari Gymnasium challenges agents to achieve soft landings using controlled thrusters. A Deep Q-Learning (DQN) model was implemented, utilizing techniques like experience replay, target networks, and an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.
